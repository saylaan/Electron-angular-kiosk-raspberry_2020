### Simple solution
What is implemented here is a `parentDynamicComponent` which is inserted in all widgets and inside it is using `*ngIf` to initialize the correct widget depending on it's `type`.
To communicate resize, drag and other events added code with EventEmitters.
For more info look at source code of this demo.

### Alternative
You can load dynamic components in Angular4+ with the help of [ng-dynamic-component library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-dynamic-component)
